    <title>Optimal Decision Boundaries</title>
    <link>https://mathformachines.com/posts/decision/index.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Over the next few posts, we will investigate <em>decision boundaries</em>. A decision boundary is a graphical representation of the solution to a classification problem. Decision boundaries can help us to understand what kind of solution might be appropriate for a problem. They can also help us to understand the how various machine learning classifiers arrive at a solution.</p>
<p>In this post, we will look at a problem’s <em>optimal</em> decision boundary, which we can find when we know exactly how our data was generated. The optimal decision boundary represents the “best” solution possible for that problem. Consequently, by looking at the complexity of this boundary and at how much error it produces, we can get an idea of the inherent difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>Unless we have generated the data ourselves, we won’t usually be able to find the optimal boundary. Instead, we approximate it using a classifier. A good machine learning classifier tries to approximate the optimal boundary for a problem as closely as possible.</p>
<p>In future posts, we will look at the approximating boundary created by various classification algorithms. We will investigate the strategy the classifier uses to create this boundary and how this boundary evolves as the classifier is trained on more and more data. There are many classification algorithms available to a data scientist – regression, discriminant analysis, decision trees, neural networks, to name a few – and it is important to understand which algorithm is appropritate for the problem at hand. Decision boundaries can help us to do this.</p>

<h1 id="optimal-boundaries">Optimal Boundaries</h1>
<p>A classification problem asks: given some observations of a thing, what is the best way to assign that thing to a class based on some of its features? For instance, we might want to predict whether a person will like a movie or not based on some data we have about them, the “features” of that person.</p>
<p>A solution to the classification problem is a rule that partitions the features and assigns each all the features of a partition to the same class. The “boundary” of this partitioning is the <strong>decision boundary</strong> of the rule.</p>
<p>It might be that two observations have exactly the same features, but are assigned to different classes. (Two things that look the same in the ways we’ve observed might differ in ways we haven’t observed.) In terms of probabilities this means both <span class="math display">\[P(C = 0 \mid X) \gt 0\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[P(C = 1 \mid X) \gt 0\]</span> In other words, we might not be able with full certainty to classify an observation. We could however assign the observation to its <em>most probable</em> class. This gives us the decision rule <span class="math display">\[ \hat{C} = \operatorname*{argmax}_c P(C = c \mid X) \]</span></p>
<p>The boundary that this rule produces is the <strong>optimal decision boundary</strong>. It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation">MAP estimate</a> of the class label, and it is the rule that minimizes classification error under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function#0-1_loss_function">zero-one loss function</a>. We will look at error and loss more in a future post.</p>
<p>We will consider <em>binary</em> classification problems, meaning, there will only be two possible classes, 0 or 1. For a binary classification problem, the optimal boundary occurs at those points where each class is equally probable: <span class="math display">\[ P(C = 0 \mid X) = P(C = 1 \mid X) \]</span></p>
<h1 id="prepare-r">Prepare R</h1>
<p>We will use R to do our analysis. We’ll have a chance to try out <code>gganimate</code> and <code>patchwork</code>, a couple of newer packages that <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> has been working on; they are really nice.</p>
<p>Here we’ll define some functions to produce plots of our examples. All of these assume a classification problem where our response is binary, <span class="math inline">\(C \in \{0, 1\}\)</span>, and is predicted by two continuous features, <span class="math inline">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Briefly, they are</p>
<ol>
<li><code>gg_sample</code> :: creates a layer for a sample of the features colored by class.</li>
<li><code>gg_density</code> :: creates a layer of contour plots for feature densities within each class.</li>
<li><code>gg_optimal</code> :: creates a layer showing an optimal decision boundary.</li>
<li><code>gg_mix_label</code> :: creates a layer labelling components in a mixture distribution.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="decision-boundaries-for-continuous-features">Decision Boundaries for Continuous Features</h1>
<p>Decision boundaries are most easily visualized whenever we have <em>continuous</em> features, most especially when we have <em>two</em> continuous features, because then the decision boundary will exist in a plane.</p>
<p>With two continuous features, the feature space will form a plane, and a decision boundary in this feature space is a set of one or more curves that divide the plane into distinct regions. Inside of a region, all observations will be assigned to the same class.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, whenever we know exactly how our data was generated, we can produce the optimal decision boundary. Though this won’t usually be possible in practice, investigating the optimal boundaries produced from simulated data can still help us to understand their properties.</p>
<p>We will look at the optimal boundary for a binary classification problem on a with features on a couple of common distributions: a multivariate normal distribution and a mixture of normal distributions.</p>
<h2 id="normally-distributed-features">Normally Distributed Features</h2>
<p>In a binary classification problem, whenever the features for each class jointly have a multivariate normal distribution, the optimal decision boundary is relatively simple. We will start our investigation here.</p>
<p>With two features, the feature space is a plane. It can be shown that the optimal decision boundary in this case will either be a line or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section">conic section</a> (that is, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola). With higher dimesional feature spaces, the decision boundary will form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric">quadric surface</a>.</p>
<p>We will consider classification problems with two classes, <span class="math inline">\(C = {0, 1}\)</span>, and two features, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Each class will be Bernoulli distributed and the features for each class will be distributed normally. Specifically,</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Classes</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\( C \sim \operatorname{Bernoulli}(p) \)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Features for Class 0</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\( (X, Y) \mid C = 0 \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\mu_0, \Sigma_0) \)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Features for Class 1</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\( (X, Y) \mid C = 1 \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\mu_0, \Sigma_1) \)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Our goal is to produce two kinds of visualizations: one, of a sample from these distributions, and two, the contours of the class-conditional densities for each feature. We’ll use the <code>mvnfast</code> package to help us with computations on the joint MVN.</p>
<h3 id="samples">Samples</h3>
<p>Let’s choose some values for our parameters. We’ll start with the case when the classes occur equally often. For our features, we’ll choose means so that there is some significant overlap between the two classes, and covariance matrices so that the distributions have a nice elliptical shape.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- 0.5
mu_0 &lt;- c(0, 2)
sigma_0 &lt;- matrix(c(1, 0.3, 0.3, 1), nrow = 2)

sigma_1 &lt;- matrix(c(1, -0.3, -0.3, 1), nrow = 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ll write a function to create a dataframe containing a sample of classified features from our distribution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; Generate normally distributed feature samples for a binary

    sample_mvn &lt;- as_tibble(
        rbind(mvnfast::rmvn(n_0,
                            mu = mu_0,
                            sigma = sigma_0),
              mvnfast::rmvn(n_1,

</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we’ll create a sample of 4000 points and plot the result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n &lt;- 4000

<p>It should be apparent that because of the overlap in these distributions, any decision rule will necessarily misclassify some observations fairly often.</p>
<h3 id="classes-on-the-feature-space">Classes on the Feature Space</h3>
<p>Next, we will produce some contour plots of our feature distributions.

<p>Notice how the boundary runs through the points where the contours of the two conditional distributions intersect. These points of intersection are where the classes have equal posterior probability.</p>
<h2 id="mixture-of-normals">Mixture of Normals</h2>
<p>The features of each class might also be modeled as a <em>mixture</em> of normal distributions. This means that each observation in a class will come from one of <em>several</em> normal distributions; in our case, the distributions from a class will be joined by a common hyperparameter, their mean.</p>
<p>In description, at least, the problem is still relatively simple. The possible decision boundaries produced, however, can be quite complex. This is a much more difficult problem than the one we saw before.</p>
<p>For our examples, we will generate the data as follows:</p>

<p>The computations for the mixture of MVNs are fairly similar to the ones we did before. First let’s define a sampling function. This function just implements the above steps.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve only seen the case where the two classes occur about equally often. If one class has a lower probability of occuring (say class 1), then the optimal decision boundary must move toward the class 1 distribution in order to equalize the probabilities on either side. This should help illustrate why it’s important to consider class imbalance whenever you’re working on a classification problem. A large imbalance can change your decisions drastically.</p>
<p>To see this change, we will use the <code>gganimate</code> package to produce an animation showing how the optimal boundary changes as the Bernoulli parameter (the frequency of class 0) changes from 0.1 to 0.9.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this post, we reviewed <strong>decision boundaries</strong>, a way of visualizing classification rules. In particular, we looked at <strong>optimal</strong> decision boundaries, which represent the <em>best</em> solution possible to a problem given certain costs for misclassification. The rule we used in this post was the <strong>MAP</strong> estimate, which minimizes zero-one loss, where all misclassifications are equally likely.</p>
<p>In future posts, we’ll look other kinds of loss functions and how that can affect the decision rule, and also at the boundaries produced by a number of statistical learning models.</p>

    <title>Six Varieties of Gaussian Discriminant Analysis</title>
    <link>https://mathformachines.com/posts/discriminant-analysis/index.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="HEADER drawer">

</div>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)</strong> is the name for a family of classifiers that includes the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis">linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_classifier#Quadratic_discriminant_analysis">quadratic</a> classifiers. These classifiers use class-conditional normal distributions as the data model for their observed features:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(X \mid C = c) \sim Normal(\mu_c, \Sigma_c) \]</span></p>
<p>As we saw in the post on <a href="https://mathformachines.com/posts/decision/">optimal decision boundaries</a>, the classification problem is solved by maximizing the posterior probability of class <span class="math inline">\(C=c\)</span> given the observed data <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes&#39;_theorem">Bayes’ theorem</a>, the addition of class distributions to our model then determines the problem completely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(C = c \mid X) = \frac{p(X \mid C = c)p(C=c)}{\Sigma_{c&#39;} p(X \mid C = c&#39;)p(C=c&#39;)} \]</span></p>
<p>A typical set of class-conditional distributions for a binary classification problem might look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/feature-distributions.png" title="feature-distributions" alt="Left: A sample from the feature distributions for the two-class case. Right: Their densities." width="800" /><figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> A sample from the feature distributions for the two-class case. <strong>Right:</strong> Their densities.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The classification problem then is to draw a boundary that optimally separates the two distributions.</p>
<p>Typically, this boundary is formed by comparing <em>discriminant functions</em>, obtained by plugging in normal densities into the Bayes’ formula above. For a given observation, these discriminant functions assign a score to each class; the class with the highest score is the class chosen for that observation.</p>
<p>In the most general case, the discriminant function looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \delta_c(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \log \lvert\Sigma_c\rvert - \frac{1}{2}(x-\mu_c)^\top \Sigma_c^{-1}(x-\mu_c) + \log \pi_c \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_c = p(C = c)\)</span> is the prior probability of class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The optimal decision boundary is formed where the contours of the class-conditional densities intersect – because this is where the classes’ discriminant functions are equal – and it is the covariance matricies <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_k\)</span> that determine the shape of these contours. And so, by making additional assumptions about how the covariance should be modeled, we can try to tune the performance of our classifier to the data of interest.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll look at a few simple assumptions we can make about <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_k\)</span> and how that affects the kinds of decisions the classifier will arrive at. In particular, we’ll see that there are <em>six kinds</em> of models we can produce depending on <em>three</em> different assumptions.</p>

<h1 id="three-questionssix-kinds">Three Questions/Six Kinds</h1>
<p>Let’s phrase these assumptions as questions. The first question regards the relationship between the covariance matricies of all the classes. The second and third are about the relationship of the features within a class.</p>
<p><strong>I.</strong> Are all the covariance matrices modeled separately, or is there one that they share? If separate, then the decision boundaries will be <em>quadratic</em>. If shared, then the decision boundaries will be <em>linear</em>. (<em>Separate</em> means <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_c \neq \Sigma_d\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(c \neq d\)</span>. <em>Shared</em> means <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_c = \Sigma\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.)</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><strong>II.</strong> May the features within a class be correlated? If correlated, then the elliptical contours of the distribution will be at an angle. If independent, then they can only vary independently along each axis (up and down, left and right). (<em>Independent</em> means <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_k\)</span> is a diagonal matrix for all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/correlated-uncorrelated.png" title="correlated-uncorrelated" alt="Left: Distribution with correlated features. Right: Distribution with uncorrelated features." width="800" /><figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Distribution with <em>correlated</em> features. <strong>Right:</strong> Distribution with <em>uncorrelated</em> features.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>III.</strong> If the features within a class are uncorrelated, might they still differ by their standard deviations? If so, then the contours of the distribution can be <em>elliptical</em>. If not, then the contours will be <em>spherical</em>. (“No” means <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_k = \sigma_k I\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, a multiple of the identity matrix.)</p>

</figure>
<p>This gives us <em>six</em> different kinds of Gaussian disciminant analysis.</p>

</figure>
<p>The more “no”s to these questions, the more restrictive the model is, and the more stable its decision boundary will be.</p>
<p>Whether this is good or bad depends on the data to which the model is applied. If there are a large number of observations relative to the number of features (a very <em>long</em> dataset), then the data can support a model with weaker assumptions. More flexible models require larger datasets in order to learn properties of the distributions that were not “built-in” by assumptions. The payoff is that there is less chance that the resulting model will differ a great deal from the true model.</p>
<p>But a model with the regularizing effect of strong assumptions might perform better when the number of observations is small relative to the number of features (a very <em>wide</em> dataset). Especially in high dimenions, the data may be so sparse that the classes are still well-separated by linear boundaries, even if the true boundaries are not linear. In very high-dimensional spaces (<span class="math inline">\(p &gt; N\)</span>, there is not even enough data to obtain the MLE estimate, in which case some kind of regularization is necessary to even begin the problem.</p>
<p>So so that we know what kinds of assumptions we can make about <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_k\)</span>, let’s take a look at how they affect the properties of the classifier.</p>
<h2 id="quadratic-vs-linear">Quadratic vs Linear</h2>
<p>The most common distinction in discriminant classifiers is the distinction between those that have <em>quadratic</em> boundaries and those that have <em>linear</em> boundaries. As mentioned, the former go by <em>quadratic discriminant analysis</em> and the latter by <em>linear discriminant analysis</em>.</p>
<p>Recall the discriminant function for the general case:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \delta_c(x) = -\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu_c)^\top \Sigma_c^{-1} (x - \mu_c) - \frac{1}{2}\log |\Sigma_c| + \log \pi_c \]</span></p>
<p>Notice that this is a quadratic function: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> occurs twice in the first term. We obtain the decision boundary between two classes <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> by setting equal their discriminant functions <span class="math inline">\( \delta_c(x) - \delta_d(x) = 0 \)</span>. The set of solutions to this equation is the decision boundary. Whenever the covariance matrices <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_d\)</span> are <em>distinct</em>, this will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric">quadric</a> equation forming a quadric surface. In two dimensions, these surfaces are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section">conic sections</a>: parabolas, hyperbolas, and ellipses.</p>

<figcaption>The optimal decision boundary generated by pairs of unequal covariance matrices.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>Now let’s assume the covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is the <em>same</em> for every class. After simplification of the equation <span class="math inline">\(\delta_c(x) - \delta_d(x) = 0\)</span>, there remains in this case only a single term depending on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p>

<h2 id="correlated-vs-uncorrelated">Correlated vs Uncorrelated</h2>
<p>The first question (quadratic vs. linear) concerned the relationship <em>between</em> the features of each class and thus determined the shape of the boundaries that separate them. The next two questions are about the classes individually. These questions concern the shape of the distributions themselves.</p>
<p>The second question asks whether we model the features within a class as being correlated or not. Recall the form of a covariance matrix for two variables,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}\operatorname{Var}(X_1) &amp; \operatorname{Cov}(X_1, X_2) \\
\operatorname{Cov}(X_2, X_1) &amp; \operatorname{Var}(X_2)\end{bmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>Whenever the RVs are <em>uncorrelated</em>, the covariance entries will equal 0, and the matrix becomes diagonal,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}\operatorname{Var}(X_1) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \operatorname{Var}(X_2)\end{bmatrix}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, each feature can only vary individually along its own axis. Thinking about the covariance matrix as a linear transformation, this means that the distribution’s elliptical contours are obtained through a <em>scaling transform</em> applied to circles. In other words, the contours can vary through stretching and shrinking along an axis, but <em>not</em> through a rotation.</p>

<p>The boundaries formed are quadratic because the two distributions have unequal covariances. If we kept the covariance matrices the same, all of the boundaries would remain linear.</p>
<p>When normally distributed variables are uncorrelated, they are also independent. This means that the diagonal models here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes classifiers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="elliptical-vs-spherical">Elliptical vs Spherical</h2>
<p>The final question question concerns whether we put an additional constraint on diagonal covariance matricies, namely, whether we restrict the variances of the two features within a class to be equal. Calling this common variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, such matrices look like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma^2 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma^2 \end{bmatrix} = \sigma^2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} = \sigma^2 I\]</span></p>
<p>So, such matrices are simply scalar multiples of an identity matrix. The contours of the class-conditional distributions are spheres, and the decision boundaries themselves are also spherical.</p>

<p>Applied to standardized observations, a model of this sort would simply classify observations based upon their distance to the class means. In this way, Spherical LDA is equivalent to the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_centroid_classifier">nearest centroid classifier</a></strong>.</p>
<h1 id="model-mis-specification">Model Mis-specification</h1>
<p>The performance of a classifier will depend on how well its decision rule models the true data-generating distribution. The GDA family attempts to model the true distribution directly, and its performance will depend on how closely the true distribution resembles the chosen <span class="math inline">\(Normal(\mu_c, \Sigma_c)\)</span>.</p>
<p>What happens when the model diverges from the truth? Generally, the model will either not be flexible enough to fit the true decision boundary (inducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a>), or it will be overly flexible and will tend to overfit the data (inducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a>). In the first case, no amount of data will ever achieve the optimal error rate, while in the second case, the classifier does not use its data efficiently; in high dimensional domains, the amount of data needed to fit an under-specified model may be intractable.</p>
<p>To get a sense for these phenomena, let’s observe the behavior of a few of our GDA classifiers when we fit them on another distribution’s data model.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>In this example, the data was generated from a Diagonal QDA model. Show below are the LDA, Diagonal QDA, and QDA classifiers being fit to samples of increasing size.</p>

<figcaption>Three discriminant classifiers being fit to data from a Diagonal QDA model. The optimal boundary is shown as a dashed line. <b>Left:</b> LDA. <b>Center:</b> Diagonal QDA. <b>Right:</b> QDA.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What we should notice is that the LDA model never achieves a good fit to the optimal boundary because it is constrained in a way inconsistent with the true model. On the other hand, the QDA model does achieve a good fit, but it requires more data to do so than the Diagonal QDA model. (Incidentally, I think the odd shape of the Diagonal QDA model in the center is an artifact of the way the <code>{sparsediscrim}</code> package constructs its decision rule. Apparently, it does so through some kind of linear sum. In any case, it seems quite efficient.)</p>]]></description>
